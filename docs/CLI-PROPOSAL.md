# Proposal: a kaimahi scaffolder CLI

**Status: proposal. Not GO. No code in this PR.**

The board files `npx kaimahi create agent` under *Under consideration — do
not build yet*, and requires a written survey against kagent's existing CLI
before any net-new CLI code lands. This document is that survey plus a
proposed surface. It ends in open decisions the user needs to rule on.

The ask, as given: `npx kaimahi create agent --options ...` plus CRUD, an
install path "if we really need", and the background security aspects.

## Survey: what kagent's CLI already ships

Verified by running the pinned binary, not from docs — `kagent v0.9.12`
(commit `b459905`, built 2026-07-20), the version this repo installs:

```
kagent --help
```

| Command | What it does | Overlaps our ask? |
|---|---|---|
| `init [framework] [language] [name]` | **scaffolds a new agent project** — flags `--model-provider`, `--model-name`, `--instruction-file`, `--description` | **directly** — this is a `create agent` |
| `install --profile minimal\|demo` | installs kagent into the current cluster | **directly** — this is an `install` |
| `deploy <dir> --env-file .env` | reads `kagent.yaml`, creates Secrets from the `.env`, creates the Agent CRD; `--dry-run` emits YAML | create/update |
| `get agent\|session\|tool` | read/list | the **R** in CRUD |
| `invoke --agent --task` | converse (streaming, sessions) | — |
| `add-mcp` | add an MCP server to `kagent.yaml`, wizard or flags | P3 connectors |
| `run <dir>` | run the project locally via docker-compose + chat | — |
| `build <dir> --image --push` | build/push the agent image | — |
| `uninstall`, `dashboard`, `bug-report`, `version`, `completion` | — | `install`'s inverse; UI |

**This is the finding that matters: `kagent init` and `kagent install`
already exist.** Two of the three things asked for are shipped upstream. A
proposal that ignored this is exactly the mistake the prime directive was
written to prevent.

## What survives the survey

Three gaps are real. They are narrow, and they are the *only* defensible
justification for net-new CLI code.

**1. `kagent init` scaffolds a code project, not declarative YAML.**
It generates an ADK framework project — source tree, Dockerfile,
`kagent.yaml` — which you then `build` and `deploy`. This repo's artifact is
the opposite: a `type: Declarative` Agent + ModelConfig in one applyable
file, no image, no build step ([`k8s/hello-world.yaml`](../k8s/hello-world.yaml)).
Nothing upstream scaffolds *that*. The declarative path is the one leadership
asked for ("agent as code — ideally yaml template").

**2. `kagent install` assumes a cluster already exists.**
It installs kagent into your current context. It does not create the kind
cluster, stand up the in-cluster Ollama server, or pull a model. The
zero-to-ready journey — the thing `make up` encodes and the thing a new
person actually needs — is uncovered.

**3. `kagent deploy` takes API keys from a `.env` file on disk.**
Its help is explicit: the `.env` *must* contain `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
`OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`, and the command loads it into a
Secret. That is precisely the custody model this project rejects — keys go
in via stdin and nowhere else, never a file, argv, env listing, or log
([`docs/models.md`](models.md)). There is also no preset switching
(`make use PRESET=`) upstream.

Note what gap 3 means: this is not a convenience gap, it is a security
disagreement with upstream. That is the strongest argument in the proposal
and the one worth leading with.

**A fourth, same shape as the first.** `kagent add-mcp` writes MCP server
entries into a project's `kagent.yaml` — again the code-project path. The
declarative equivalent is `spec.declarative.tools[]` with a `toolNames`
allowlist, now shipped in [`k8s/tools-agent.yaml`](../k8s/tools-agent.yaml)
(P3). Nothing upstream scaffolds that either, so a `--tools` flag falls out
of gap 1 rather than being a separate ask.

## Uncomfortable question the survey raises

All three gaps are already filled — by the Makefile. `make up` does gap 2,
`k8s/hello-world.yaml` plus `make use` do gaps 1 and 3. So the honest
question is not "should we build a CLI" but **"what does a CLI buy over the
Makefile?"**

One answer holds up: **you have to clone the repo to use a Makefile.**
`npx` is consumption without a clone, from an empty directory, in someone
else's project. That is the "consume anywhere" property, and it is the
whole case. If we are not willing to publish to npm, the case collapses and
the Makefile is sufficient — and publishing means claiming the name, which
D9 says needs explicit approval and two ungated reviews first.

## Proposed surface

Scaffold-only. Everything kagent already does is delegated, not wrapped.

> Built as specified, with one change ruled later: the grammar is
> **noun-verb** (`agent create`), not `create agent`, so resources group as
> the surface grows. Shipped shape and flags: `docs/CLI-PROTOTYPE.md`.

```bash
npx github:kaimahi-agents/kaimahi#<commit-sha> agent create <name> [--options]
```

| Flag | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `--model <preset>` | `ollama` (default, keyless) \| `anthropic` \| `openai` \| `openrouter` \| `github-copilot` \| `azure-foundry` \| `openai-compatible` |
| `--model-name <id>` | override the model ID within the preset |
| `--base-url <url>` | for `openai-compatible` / `azure-foundry` |
| `--instructions <file>` | system message from a file (mirrors `kagent init --instruction-file`) |
| `--description <text>` | Agent description |
| `--namespace <ns>` | default `kagent` |
| `--out <dir>\|-` | write YAML to a directory, or `-` for stdout (GitOps-friendly) |
| `--tools <server>[:<tool>,...]` | wire `spec.declarative.tools[]`; **allowlist required**, never "all tools" |
| `--apply` | apply to the current context (off by default — generate, don't mutate) |
| `--dry-run` | server-side dry-run against live CRDs |
| `--yes` | non-interactive; without flags, an `add-mcp`-style wizard runs |

Default behaviour is **generate a file and print the next command**. It does
not touch a cluster unless you ask it to. That keeps it a scaffolder.

### CRUD — deferred, and here is the data for the ruling

You skipped this question; it is left open deliberately. The survey now
constrains it more than it did when asked:

- **R** is `kagent get agent` and `kubectl get agents`. Two shipped
  implementations already.
- **D** is `kubectl delete agent <name>`.
- **U** is `kubectl apply` of the edited YAML — which is the point of agent
  as code; a CLI `update` command competes with `git diff`.
- **C** is the only letter with a genuine gap (declarative YAML scaffolding).

So "CRUD" as a whole is close to a re-implementation of `kubectl`. The
options remain: scaffold-only on local YAML; scaffold plus apply/delete;
or full lifecycle against the cluster. My read is that anything past
scaffold-plus-apply spends the project's credibility on the exact mistake
that caused the restart — but this needs your ruling, not mine.

### `install` — recommend not building

`kagent install` exists. The uncovered part is the cluster underneath it. If
anything is built here it should be honest about being that and nothing
else — a `kaimahi up`-shaped command that creates kind, stands up Ollama,
pulls the model, then **calls `kagent install`** rather than reimplementing
it. Under the answer you gave ("install if we really need"), the survey says
we do not need `install`; we might need `up`.

## Background: security aspects

A scaffolder that people run with `npx` is a supply-chain component and a
credential-adjacent tool. Both need answering before code, not after.

**Supply chain — `npx` runs remote code on the user's machine.**

- Publish with npm provenance (Sigstore attestation), so the tarball is
  traceable to a signed CI run in this repo.
- **No install scripts.** No `preinstall`/`postinstall`; document
  `npx --ignore-scripts` as safe.
- Pin and lock transitive dependencies; prefer a near-zero-dependency
  implementation. A scaffolder that emits YAML does not need a large tree.
- Document a pinned invocation. While unpublished (D19) that means a git
  ref — `npx github:kaimahi-agents/kaimahi#<tag>` — because a bare branch
  reference, like a bare `npx` on a published package, is a mutable
  remote-code channel.
- Any binary the CLI fetches (e.g. the kagent CLI) must be checksum-verified
  before execution — the Makefile already does this and the CLI must not
  regress it.

**Credential custody — the differentiator; do not weaken it.**

- The CLI **never** accepts a key as a flag, an environment variable, or a
  file path. Stdin only, straight into a Kubernetes Secret.
- It must never call `kagent deploy --env-file`, and must never generate a
  `.env`. That would import upstream's weaker custody model into ours and
  discard the reason this component exists.
- Generated YAML contains Secret *references*, never Secret *values*. A
  scaffolder that can write a key into a file it also suggests committing is
  a credential-leak generator.
- Nothing is cached to disk except what already is (the Copilot OAuth token,
  0600, per [`scripts/copilot-secret.sh`](../scripts/copilot-secret.sh)).

**Blast radius — it holds a kubeconfig.**

- Print the target context and namespace, and require explicit confirmation
  before mutating anything that is not a local kind cluster. `--apply` on a
  production context by accident is the obvious foot-gun.
- Fail closed: a partial scaffold applies nothing; a failed validation
  writes nothing.
- No telemetry. If that ever changes it is opt-in and ruled on the board.

**Note the ordering problem.** A scaffolder is the natural place to *ask*
for a key, and today there is no budget, metering, or ledger behind it (P4).
Making it easy to point a fresh agent at a billed endpoint, with no
governance, is a real risk the CLI introduces. Until P4, the CLI should
default to the keyless Ollama preset and print the ungoverned-spend warning
whenever a hosted preset is selected.

## Decided — D19 (2026-09-01)

All five are ruled; kept here so the reasoning above still reads against its
outcome. The prototype is `docs/CLI-PROTOTYPE.md`.

1. **Publish or not** → **not yet.** Internal use is
   `npx github:kaimahi-agents/kaimahi#<commit-sha>`; publishing waits on D9's cultural
   read and trademark counsel, and is a one-line change once they clear.
   The manifest is `private: true` so an accidental publish fails.
2. **The CRUD line** → **scaffold-only.** `agent create` is the only
   command; read, update and delete are refused and print the `kubectl` or
   `kagent` command that already does the job.
3. **`up` vs `install`** → **neither.** The Makefile owns cluster bring-up.
4. **Sequencing** → moot: P4 shipped first, so the CLI scaffolds governed
   agents by default, which is the outcome this section hoped for.
5. **Language/runtime** → **Node accepted**, conditional on a
   zero-runtime-dependency tree, with `make cli-test` in CI. CI asserts the
   dependency count is still zero.

## Explicitly not proposed

Anything with a working upstream implementation: `invoke`, `get`, `run`,
`build`, `dashboard`, `add-mcp`, agent runtimes, CRDs, a web UI. If a user
needs those, the CLI should print the `kagent` command rather than grow one.
