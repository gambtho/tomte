# Kaimahi documentation

Kaimahi is an incubation project: an agent defined in one YAML file,
running on Kubernetes via [kagent](https://kagent.dev), driven from your
terminal, with a governance plane in front of it. Everything documented
here runs today and was run before it was written down. Where something
is demonstrated once rather than maintained, or schema-valid rather than
live-verified, the doc says so in those words.

## Start here

```bash
make up     # kind cluster + local model + kagent + two agents (~5-10 min)
make chat   # talk to the agent
```

[Getting started](getting-started.md) is the walkthrough: prerequisites,
what `make up` actually does, the agent YAML, and how to talk to it.

## By what you want to do

| I want to… | Read | The commands |
|---|---|---|
| Get an agent running and talk to it | [getting-started.md](getting-started.md) | `make up`, `make chat`, `make status`, `make down` |
| Use a hosted model (Copilot, Anthropic, OpenAI, Azure AI Foundry, OpenRouter, anything OpenAI-compatible) | [models.md](models.md) | `make model-secret`, `make copilot-secret`, `make use PRESET=…` |
| Give the agent a tool | [tools.md](tools.md) | `make chat AGENT=hello-tools …` |
| Put a budget on the agent's LLM spend, see the ledger, keep real API keys away from the agent | [spend.md](spend.md) | `make plane`, `make govern`, `make budget`, `make ledger` |
| Control which tools the agent can call, and audit every call | [tool-governance.md](tool-governance.md) | `make govern-tools`, `make tool-allow`, `make tool-audit` |
| Have a human approve a denied action with a bounded, expiring grant | [approvals.md](approvals.md) | `make approvals`, `make approve`, `make grants` |
| Let the agent post to Slack, one approved message at a time | [slack.md](slack.md) | `make slack-secret`, `make slack-mcp`, `make govern-slack`, `make slack-post` |
| Let the outside world trigger an agent (webhooks), governed | [inbound.md](inbound.md) | `make inbound-credential`, `make inbound-secret`, `make inbound-audit` |
| Close the Slack loop: a mention triggers the agent, the agent answers in the thread (AKS) | [inbound.md](inbound.md#slack-events-the-loop) | `make inbound-expose`, `make exposure-scan`, `make inbound-unexpose` |
| Be told in Slack that a request is waiting, and approve or deny it from Slack as yourself | [approvals.md](approvals.md#deciding-from-slack) | `make slack-approvers`, `make notify-slack`, `make slack-mention` |
| See what the plane's pods can and cannot reach, and prove it | [egress.md](egress.md) | `make netpol-verify`, `make egress-copilot`, `make egress-copilot-off` |
| Run all of this on a real cluster (AKS) instead of kind | [aks.md](aks.md) | `TARGET=aks`, `make aks-cluster`, `make aks-down` |
| Fix something that went wrong | [FAQ.md](FAQ.md) | |

The docs build on each other in roughly the table's order: tool
governance assumes the plane from [spend.md](spend.md) is deployed,
approvals assume tool governance, Slack assumes approvals. Each doc says
what it assumes at the top.

## What is governed today, and what is not

Governance is opt-in per agent. This is the one table that says what
the plane covers, kept in one place so it cannot drift between docs.

| Surface | Status |
|---|---|
| LLM calls through a `governed-*` preset | **Governed**: authentication, monthly budgets that fail closed, a ledger of every call, real keys held only by the proxy ([spend.md](spend.md)) |
| LLM calls through a plain hosted preset (`openai`, `anthropic`, …) | **Ungoverned, by choice.** Nothing meters it. Switch to a governed preset to govern it |
| Tool calls through `kaimahi-tools` (after `make govern-tools`) | **Governed**: authentication, a committed upstream table, tools-only protocol scope, a per-credential allowlist, every call audited ([tool-governance.md](tool-governance.md)) |
| Tool calls through `kagent-tool-server` directly | **Ungoverned, by choice.** `make govern-tools` to govern it |
| Approvals and bounded grants | **Governed**: a denial files a request, a human mints a grant bounded by expiry and/or use count, the grant lapses ([approvals.md](approvals.md)) |
| Slack posting | **Governed**: posting is not allowlisted, it is approved per use and audited with the grant id. There is no ungoverned Slack path in the repo ([slack.md](slack.md)) |
| The Slack MCP server's own endpoint authentication | **Not effective, and no longer load-bearing.** The server (v1.3.0) ignores the injected credential on its HTTP transport; NetworkPolicy now admits only the proxy to that pod, so the bypass it was meant to close is closed at the network instead ([egress.md](egress.md)) |
| Pod-level network egress (NetworkPolicy) | **Governed** in the `kaimahi` namespace: default-deny both ways, each pod allowed exactly its paths, the Slack pod out on 443 only, and a probe proves the negative on every PR ([egress.md](egress.md)). Residuals stated there: an IP/port rule is not a URL allowlist; the `kagent` and `ollama` namespaces are unpoliced; AKS does not enforce policy unless provisioned for it |
| Inbound events (webhooks → agent) | **Governed**: signature or bearer auth before any work, replay window, per-hook rate limit and bounded queue, the target's budget checked at the door, and a bounded grant consumed per event ([inbound.md](inbound.md)). Rate limiter and queue are in-memory (single replica) |
| Internet-facing *gateway* upstreams | **Not built.** Every committed tool upstream is in-cluster; going internet-facing needs a hardened dialer and SSRF protection that do not exist yet |
| Approval routing to Slack, per-approver identity | **Governed**: a filed request is announced in the pinned channel by the plane's own post, which rides the gateway under the plane's credential (allowlisted to the posting tool, channel-pinned, audited); `@kaimahi approve <id>` / `deny <id>` from a Slack user in the Secret-mounted approver list decides it, and the grant and audit rows carry `slack:<user id>`; the admin path records `admin`. Channel membership alone decides nothing; a non-approver is refused and audited ([approvals.md](approvals.md#deciding-from-slack)). Email and ticket routing are not built; a notification the plane cannot get out is logged (a known refusal is retried, three attempts in all; an ambiguous failure never), and `make approvals` remains the queue |
| What an agent *sees* after a grant | **Lagging, not wrong.** Enforcement is immediate; the agent's discovered tool list updates on kagent's next RemoteMCPServer reconcile ([slack.md](slack.md#why-the-agent-is-never-the-one-denied)) |
| AKS | **Demonstrated, not maintained.** Three verified runs on 2026-09-01/02 (the plane, NetworkPolicy enforcement, the Slack loop through a public edge), each deleted the same day. CI stays on kind and keyless ([aks.md](aks.md)) |
| Public exposure | **One opt-in edge, one port.** Only the inbound edge (`make inbound-expose`, AKS) is internet-reachable: TLS on 443, one path, proven by `make exposure-scan`. Everything else stays cluster-internal ([inbound.md](inbound.md#putting-it-on-the-internet)) |

## How these docs are organised

They used to be eight runbooks named for the phase that built them (P1,
P2, P3, P4a, P4b, P4c, P5a, P5b). That order was how the repo was
built, not how anyone reads it: to find "how do I govern tool calls" you
had to know it was P4b. The files are now named for the capability, and
the old phase-named files are gone (their history is in git and on the
board).

Each runbook mixed three things: how to use a capability, why it is
built the way it is, and what was verified when it shipped. The rule
for what moved where:

- **Kept, user-facing:** every command, everything you will see on
  screen, every caveat, gotcha and limitation, the "verified how" status
  of each claim (CI on every PR, live once, schema-valid only, not
  verified), and the design decisions you need in order to use the thing
  correctly (why Azure AI Foundry rides `provider: OpenAI`, why grants
  must be bounded, why the small model is pinned).
- **Moved out, historical:** alternatives-considered lists, porting
  provenance, surveys of what was not built, phase cross-references, and
  the narrative of the verifying run. All of that is in the delta sheets
  in [COORDINATION.md](COORDINATION.md), which is the project's record
  and stays the authoritative one.

If a caveat is missing from a capability doc that used to be in a
runbook, that is a bug in the restructure, not a decision. File it.

## Project docs, not user docs

- [COORDINATION.md](COORDINATION.md): the coordination board, decisions,
  and delta sheets. Owned by the coordinator session.
- [CLI-PROPOSAL.md](CLI-PROPOSAL.md): the `kaimahi agent create`
  scaffolder — surveyed, ruled on, prototyped in a pull request that was
  closed unmerged. Kept as the record of what was considered and why;
  nothing from it is on main.
- [SCENARIOS.md](SCENARIOS.md): the delegation journeys that argue for
  the governance plane.
- [NAMING.md](NAMING.md): the project name and what is still owed before
  it is final.
