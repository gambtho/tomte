# Getting started

From an empty machine to a conversation with an agent that is defined
entirely in YAML. Everything runs on [kagent](https://kagent.dev):
kagent's controller provisions the agent, kagent's CLI talks to it.
Kaimahi adds no runtime code at this point, only the YAML, a values file,
and `kmx` — one command that glues `kind`, `helm`, `kubectl` and the kagent
CLI together. Nothing runs in your cluster that is not kagent's or
Kubernetes' own.

Every command here was run against a live cluster before it was written
down. Model replies vary run to run; where one is quoted, expect the same
substance and different wording.

## Prerequisites

| Tool | Why | Install |
|------|-----|---------|
| Go 1.26+ | builds/installs `kmx`, which every command below runs through | <https://go.dev/dl/> |
| Docker **or** Podman | kind runs Kubernetes in containers | <https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/> · <https://podman.io/docs/installation> |
| kind | local Kubernetes cluster | <https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation> |
| kubectl | cluster interaction | <https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/> |
| Helm | installs kagent | <https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/> |
| make, curl | glue | your package manager |

### Using Podman instead of Docker

Pass `CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` to any target. It is explicit rather than
auto-detected, so the engine that built an image is always visible in the
command:

```bash
make up   KIND_CLUSTER=<your-name> CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman
make plane KIND_CLUSTER=<your-name> CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman
make down KIND_CLUSTER=<your-name> CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman
```

Set it once per shell with `export CONTAINER_ENGINE=podman` if you never use
Docker. **Pass it to every target for a given cluster** — kind reaches a
podman cluster only with `KIND_EXPERIMENTAL_PROVIDER=podman`, which the
Makefile sets from this variable, so a cluster created with one engine is
invisible to the other and looks like "kind lost my cluster".

On macOS the podman machine must be able to read your checkout. Machines
created with the defaults mount `/Users`, `/private` and `/var/folders`; a
machine created without them fails the build with
`faccessat <path>: connection refused`. Check with:

```bash
podman machine inspect --format '{{.Name}}'
podman run --rm -v "$HOME":/h:ro alpine ls /h   # must list your home directory
```

Volumes can only be set when the machine is created, so a machine missing
them has to be recreated:

```bash
podman machine rm <name>
podman machine init --volume "$HOME:$HOME"
podman machine start
```

No API key is needed anywhere: the default model is an in-cluster
[Ollama](https://ollama.com) server running `qwen2.5:3b` (free, local,
keyless). Hosted models are in [models.md](models.md).

## Up, and a first conversation

Install `kmx` — one binary, no clone:

```bash
go install github.com/kaimahi-agents/kaimahi/cmd/kmx@main
```

```bash
kmx up      # kind cluster + Ollama + model pull + kagent + two agents (first run ~5-10 min)
kmx agent chat hello-world "Who are you and where are you running?"
kmx status  # agents, modelconfigs, pods
kmx down    # delete the kind cluster (and everything in it, ledger included)
```

`kmx` is the whole journey in one command; [kmx.md](kmx.md) is its
reference, including what it deliberately does *not* do (budgets, approvals,
the connector families, capturing a secret, and AKS are still the
Makefile's).

### Governing that agent

Nothing above is metered. The plane is a second command, and on kind it is
keyless too:

```bash
kmx plane               # metering proxy + Postgres ledger, in the cluster
kmx govern hello-world  # issue the credential, switch the agent onto it
kmx agent chat hello-world "Who are you and where are you running?"
kmx ledger              # what that answer cost, attributed to a credential
```

`kmx plane` needs no clone and no registry: it fetches the plane's source
from the public Go proxy **at kmx's own revision**, builds it, and
side-loads the image into kind. The agent is handed an opaque Kaimahi token,
never an upstream key. [spend.md](spend.md) is what the plane does;
[kmx.md](kmx.md#how-the-plane-gets-there-without-a-clone) is how it gets
there.

### The same journey from a clone

Everything below uses `make`, and every one of these targets now calls the
same `kmx` binary — the Makefile builds it from the checkout. Use whichever
you prefer; they run the same code.

```bash
make up     # kind cluster + Ollama + model pull + kagent + two agents (first run ~5-10 min)
make chat   # ask the default question
```

`make chat` prints the raw A2A task JSON. Buried in it is the reply,
from a real run:

```text
"I am the hello_world agent, designed to greet users and provide
information about myself. I am running on Kubernetes via kagent."
```

The underscore in `hello_world` is real: kagent normalizes the agent name
internally, and that is the name the model sees and repeats.

Ask your own question, or talk to the second agent, which has a tool:

```bash
make chat TASK="What are you defined in?"
make chat AGENT=hello-tools TASK="What pods are running in the ollama namespace?"
```

The tools agent is covered in [tools.md](tools.md), including why its
prose summary is less reliable than the tool call underneath it.

## An agent of your own

```bash
kmx agent create fleet-reporter \
  --description "Reports what is running in the cluster." \
  --instructions ./fleet.md \
  --tools kagent-tool-server:k8s_get_resources
```

That writes `agents/fleet-reporter.yaml` — the same kind of document as the
one below, which you own, review and commit — and applies it. The tool
allowlist is mandatory: naming a server alone would grant every tool it
offers, today and after its next release. `kmx` never accepts a credential
in any form, and refuses to write a manifest with anything key-shaped in it.
[kmx.md](kmx.md#kmx-agent-create) has the full list of what it refuses and
why.

```bash
make status   # agents, modelconfigs, pods
make down     # delete the kind cluster (and everything in it, ledger included)
```

On the clone path the governed half is `make plane` and `make govern`, which
are the same kmx commands with the checkout passed as the plane's source —
so a change you make to `plane/` is what gets deployed.

Coming from the project's old name? The cluster is now `kaimahi-p1` and
the Copilot login cache moved. See
[the FAQ](FAQ.md#i-have-a-cluster-and-paths-from-the-tomte-era).

## The agent is a YAML file

There is no kaimahi runtime to install. The whole agent,
[`k8s/hello-world.yaml`](../k8s/hello-world.yaml), is a kagent `Agent`
plus the `ModelConfig` it thinks with, in one document you can read, diff,
and review:

```yaml
apiVersion: kagent.dev/v1alpha2
kind: Agent
metadata:
  name: hello-world
  namespace: kagent
spec:
  type: Declarative
  declarative:
    modelConfig: hello-world-model
    systemMessage: |
      You are Kaimahi's hello-world agent, ...
```

`kubectl apply -f` it and kagent's controller provisions a pod for it.
The topology grows the same way:
[`k8s/tools-agent.yaml`](../k8s/tools-agent.yaml) is the same shape plus
a `tools:` block. No make target ever mutates the committed file.
Switching models patches the live Agent resource, not the YAML.

## What `make up` does, step by step

The `up` target on kind runs `cluster`, `ollama`, `model`, `kagent`,
`agent`, `tools-agent`, then `status`. In plain commands:

```bash
# 1. Local Kubernetes cluster (skipped if it already exists)
kind create cluster --name kaimahi-p1

# 2. In-cluster Ollama model server (namespace, deployment, service)
kubectl apply -f k8s/ollama.yaml
kubectl -n ollama rollout status deploy/ollama

# 3. Pull the model into the Ollama pod
kubectl -n ollama exec deploy/ollama -- ollama pull qwen2.5:3b

# 4. Install kagent (CRDs chart, then the app chart), pinned to v0.9.12,
#    with Ollama as the default provider and its bundled tool server
#    switched on in locked-down form
helm upgrade --install kagent-crds \
  oci://ghcr.io/kagent-dev/kagent/helm/kagent-crds \
  --version 0.9.12 --namespace kagent --create-namespace
helm upgrade --install kagent \
  oci://ghcr.io/kagent-dev/kagent/helm/kagent \
  --version 0.9.12 --namespace kagent -f k8s/kagent-values.yaml
kubectl -n kagent wait --for=condition=Ready pods --all --timeout=420s

# 5. The agents: hello-world, then hello-tools once kagent's tool server
#    is Accepted
kubectl apply -f k8s/hello-world.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/tools-agent.yaml
```

Every step that writes to a cluster runs a guard first. On a local kind
cluster it prints a banner and proceeds; on anything else it demands a
confirmation naming the context. See [aks.md](aks.md) for why.

Re-running `make up` is safe for a governed agent. The `agent` and
`tools-agent` steps read the live agent first and, if it is on a
non-default ModelConfig or wired through the governed tool gateway, they
re-apply the committed YAML and then restore that state, with a `NOTE:`
line saying so. `make use PRESET=ollama` and `make ungovern-tools` are
the explicit ways back. An earlier version of `make up` silently reset
the agent; if you see that symptom, the
[FAQ entry](FAQ.md#my-governed-agent-stopped-showing-up-in-the-ledger)
covers it.

Overridable: `KIND_CLUSTER`, `KAGENT_VERSION`, `MODEL`, `AGENT`, `TASK`,
and `TARGET` (`kind` by default, or `aks`).

## Talking to the agent

`make chat` downloads the pinned kagent CLI to `bin/kagent`
(checksum-verified against the release's `.sha256` file), checks that the
agent answers through its Service, port-forwards the kagent controller to
`localhost:8083` (`CHAT_PORT`), and runs:

```bash
bin/kagent invoke --agent hello-world --task "Hello! Who are you and where are you running?"
```

If the port-forward does not come up on the port it asked for, `make chat`
refuses rather than invoking, because another cluster's forward on that
port would happily answer with a plausible reply from the wrong cluster.
Use `CHAT_PORT=<free port> make chat` when two clusters are up at once.

Other ways in, all shipped by kagent:

```bash
kubectl -n kagent get agents            # CRD status (Ready / Accepted)
bin/kagent get agent                    # via the CLI (needs the port-forward)
bin/kagent dashboard                    # kagent's web UI
```

## Choices and caveats

- **Model**: `qwen2.5:3b` (~2 GB). kagent's runtime gives every agent a
  built-in `ask_user` tool; smaller models (`llama3.2:1b`/`3b`) misfire it
  with malformed arguments and the invocation fails with
  `'str' object has no attribute 'get'`. Telling the model not to use the
  tool in the system message does not stop it. Qwen 2.5 answers plainly.
  Any tool-capable Ollama model works via `make model MODEL=<tag>` plus
  the `model:` field in the two agent YAML files, but invocation-test it
  with several fresh chats before trusting it. "It's a known model" is
  not a test. Both small-model failure modes are in the
  [FAQ](FAQ.md#the-agent-errors-with-str-object-has-no-attribute-get).
- **Models are pod-local**: the Ollama pod stores models in an
  `emptyDir`, so a pod restart re-pulls (`make model`). Deliberate: no
  PVC to manage in a demo.
- **Version pin**: kagent v0.9.12 (`KAGENT_VERSION`), the latest stable
  at the time; 0.10 was still in RC. The Agent CRD's `runtime: go`
  variant does not work out of the box at this version: the chart's
  default registry (`cr.kagent.dev`) does not carry `golang-adk:0.9.12`
  (ImagePullBackOff), though the image does exist on `ghcr.io`. If you
  need the go runtime, set `controller.agentImage.registry=ghcr.io` in
  [`k8s/kagent-values.yaml`](../k8s/kagent-values.yaml). The agents here
  stay on the default python runtime. (Verified at 0.9.12 when the pin
  was chosen; not re-verified in this restructure.)
- **`make down` deletes everything**, including the governance plane's
  Postgres and its ledger, if you have deployed them. Demo-durable, not
  backup-managed.

## Where next

- A hosted model instead of the local one: [models.md](models.md).
- What the tools agent can do and how a real tool call is proven:
  [tools.md](tools.md).
- Budgets, a ledger, and keeping real API keys away from the agent:
  [spend.md](spend.md).
- Running the plane for real — two replicas, probes, metrics, backup and
  restore, and what is still not highly available:
  [operations.md](operations.md).
