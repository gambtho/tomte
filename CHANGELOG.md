# Changelog

Kaimahi is **pre-1.0 and incubating**. Versions are semantic with the pre-1.0
reading of that word:

- **Patch** (`v0.1.0` → `v0.1.1`) — fixes only. No schema change, no flag
  removed, no behaviour an operator was relying on.
- **Minor** (`v0.1.0` → `v0.2.0`) — anything else, including a breaking one.
  Below 1.0 the minor number is where breaking changes live, so every entry
  that breaks something says so under **Breaking** and says what to do about
  it.
- **Pre-release** (`v0.2.0-rc.1`) — a candidate for the version it names. Go's
  `@latest` ignores these, so a release candidate cannot become anybody's
  default install by accident.

There is no 1.0 promise yet and no support window. What there *is*: the
release job refuses to publish a tag that has no section here, so a version
without notes cannot exist.

Each entry names what changed, and — where it matters — what an operator has
to do. Sections: **Added**, **Changed**, **Fixed**, **Breaking**, **Upgrading**.

## Unreleased

_Nothing yet._

## v0.1.0 — 2026-09-03

The first tagged release. Nothing about the product changed with this tag;
what changed is that the product can now be named, installed and upgraded
without a commit hash.

### Added

- **Tagged releases, built by CI from the tag.** `kmx` binaries for
  linux/amd64, linux/arm64, darwin/amd64 and darwin/arm64, with a
  `checksums.txt` published beside them. The job refuses to publish a build
  that does not report its own tag, and refuses a tag with no entry in this
  file.
- **`go install …/cmd/kmx@latest`** as the install line — no sha, no
  package-manager namespace claimed, and no new tooling to trust: the module
  proxy and the Go checksum database already stand behind it.
- **`kmx version` reports the build's own version**, not only the versions it
  installs. A release binary reports its tag; a `go install` reports the
  version you asked for; a checkout build says it is a checkout build.
- **A documented upgrade path** ([docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md)),
  including what happens when a migration fails halfway (the plane does not
  start), and a CI job that upgrades a plane across a real schema gap with
  live data in it and proves the data survives.

### Upgrading

- From an untagged `go install …@<sha>` build: install `@latest` and run
  `kmx version`. There is no state in `kmx` itself to migrate.
- For the **plane**, see [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md#upgrading-the-plane).
  Migrations are additive and run at startup under a lock; the one behaviour
  worth knowing before you upgrade past `00008` is that tool grants minted
  before argument binding existed keep their old verb-level meaning and no
  new one can be created — the plane never widens an old grant silently.

### Not in this release

- **No container image is published.** `kmx plane` still builds the plane's
  image locally from the Go module proxy at kmx's own revision, so Go remains
  a prerequisite for the governed half even if you installed a binary. The
  reasoning is in [docs/releases.md](docs/releases.md#why-no-published-image-yet).
- **No package-manager namespace is claimed** — no Homebrew tap, no npm, no
  crates, no PyPI. The name is provisional and no trademark opinion has been
  obtained; claiming namespaces would raise the cost of a rename that may
  still happen. See [docs/NAMING.md](docs/NAMING.md).
