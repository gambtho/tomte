// Package metrics is the plane's Prometheus surface (P9, D24): what an
// operator watches, on its own cluster-internal listener, with NO
// identifier as a label value. Every label is drawn from a fixed
// vocabulary — the seams, the decisions, the refusal reasons, the grant
// kinds, the queues — or from two operator-chosen names that are
// already public in the repo and printed by every audit command: a
// credential's NAME (never its token) and an upstream's name. A channel
// id, a user id, a request id, a delivery id, a model string, or any
// free text never becomes a label; metrics_test.go asserts the label
// set and the value shapes on the live registry.
