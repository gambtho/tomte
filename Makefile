# Port-forward the kagent controller, WAIT FOR IT, then run $(1) against

# recipe and the same defect.
#
# The old form was `port-forward ... >/dev/null 2>&1 & sleep 3` and then
# an invoke that trusted the CLI's default localhost:8083. Three problems,
# and P5b makes them reachable: running a kind and a managed verification
# at once is now a first-class workflow (docs/aks.md), and the
# ports collide.
#   1. If the bind failed because ANOTHER cluster's forward already held
#      8083, the error went to /dev/null and `kagent invoke` connected to
#      that forward instead — returning a real, plausible reply from the
#      wrong cluster. It does NOT fail closed: the controller on that
#      forward answers happily. (Demonstrated while reviewing this lane.)
#      --context cannot protect this path, because the aiming happens at
#      the socket, not at kubectl.
#   2. `sleep 3` is a guess, not a readiness check.
#   3. The port was hardcoded, so the runbook's "move the ports" advice for
#      concurrent clusters could not be applied here at all.
# Now: an overridable CHAT_PORT, an explicit --kagent-url so the CLI cannot
# fall back to a port we did not open, and a wait for kubectl's own
# "Forwarding from" line that fails loudly if it never appears.
CHAT_PORT ?= 8083

# $(1) is the agent whose Service must be servable; $(2) is the command;
# $(3) optionally narrows which transport failures are retried (see below).
#
# Before invoking, prove the agent is actually SERVABLE — do not infer it.
#
# `use` already waits (`wait_switched`: kagent reconcile, `rollout status`,
# the single-pod wait; then the Agent's Ready condition) and none of it
# is sufficient during a preset-switch rollout: CI failed here twice with
#   dial tcp <clusterIP>:8080: connect: connection refused
# because at the moment of the call the Service had no ready backend (the
# old pod removed, the new one not yet propagated) — kube-proxy REJECTs
# that, so it looks like a broken agent rather than a race. Checking the
# endpoint list is also too weak: it can read ready one instant and be
# empty the next.
#
# So make the check the same thing the caller needs: fetch the agent's own
# A2A card THROUGH the Service, via the API server's service proxy. That
# resolves endpoints server-side and returns a real HTTP body, so it fails
# while there is no ready backend and succeeds only once the agent answers.
# (The kagent readiness probe uses the same path.) One kubectl call — no
# extra port, no second forward.
#
# This replaces the `sleep 3` the recipe used to rely on. That sleep was
# quietly doing this job: it is why `main` passes and why removing it
# surfaced the race. Padding is not a readiness check.
#
# The probe alone is NOT sufficient, and it is worth being precise about
# why: the API server's service proxy resolves the endpoint and connects to
# the POD directly, so it can succeed while kube-proxy has not yet
# programmed the ClusterIP the controller dials. Only the controller can
# answer "can I reach the agent", so the invoke below additionally retries
# a bounded number of times on exactly that error. It cannot mask a real
# outage: after the retries the original output and exit status are
# emitted unchanged, and a transport-error reply still fails
# verify-chat.py. Note kagent exits 0 on this error, so the retry keys on
# the message, not the status.
#
# The race has more than one symptom, and the first fix only caught one of
# them. `connection refused` is kube-proxy REJECTing when the Service has
# no ready backend; but once a backend IS programmed and the pod tears the
# connection down before answering, the controller reports instead:
#   failed to send HTTP request: Post "http://<agent>.kagent:8080": EOF
# That is the same race one moment later, and it reddened main after P5b
# merged. Retry both.
#
# The predicate is anchored to the controller's WHOLE error line, not to
# transport text anywhere in the output. The output being matched is the
# combined stdout+stderr, and stdout carries the A2A task JSON — including
# the model's own reply. An agent asked to explain one of these errors
# (the FAQ documents them) would echo the words and, with a loose match,
# trigger a second invoke: duplicate spend, and for tool calls a burned
# grant. kagent prints the failure as one line, "Error invoking session:
# <wrapped error>", ending in Go's net error; anchor both ends so a line
# that starts with `{` can never match.
#
# Two classes, because they are not equally safe to retry:
#   REFUSED  — kube-proxy REJECTed; nothing reached the agent. Always safe.
#   AMBIGUOUS — EOF / connection reset: the request may have reached the
#              agent and been acted on before the connection dropped.
# `chat` retries both (re-asking a question is acceptable). Anything whose
# task performs a non-idempotent action — slack-post, which POSTS to a
# channel under a USES-bounded grant — retries only the refused class:
# a retry after an ambiguous failure could post twice. Pass the class as
# $(3); it defaults to both.

# Wait until an agent's switch has fully landed: kagent has reconciled the
# Agent's current generation, the Deployment has rolled, and it is served
# by EXACTLY ONE pod carrying the current pod-template-hash. $(1) is the
# agent name. Replaces the bare `rollout status` every switch used to do.
#
# Three waits, because each of the obvious signals is wrong on its own:
#
# 1. kagent reconciles the Agent ASYNCHRONOUSLY. Straight after the patch,
#    `rollout status` can run before the controller has rewritten the
#    Deployment and report "successfully rolled out" about the OLD
#    template. So first wait for status.observedGeneration to reach the
#    Agent's generation. (The Ready condition is useless here: it stays
#    True, at the old observedGeneration, for the whole rollout.)
# 2. `rollout status` is then the right rollout signal, but with maxSurge
#    1 / maxUnavailable 0 it returns the moment the NEW pod is Ready —
#    while the OLD pod, still on the previous ModelConfig, is Terminating
#    (the ReplicaSet controller stops counting a pod as soon as it has a
#    deletionTimestamp, so the rollout looks complete). A chat in that
#    window can land on the old pod: a governed chat once completed with
#    an EMPTY ledger because the ungoverned pod answered it. "Governed"
#    must mean the ungoverned pod is gone, not outnumbered.
# 3. So finally wait for the pod set. The current hash is read from the
#    ReplicaSet whose revision matches the Deployment's (kagent stamps a
#    config-hash on the pod template, so a ModelConfig switch that changes
#    anything cuts a new ReplicaSet; one that changes nothing — e.g.
#    hello-world-model → ollama, identical specs — rolls nothing and
#    passes straight through). The pod listing is compared as a whole: it
#    equals the hash only when there is one pod and it is that pod.
#    Terminating pods still list, which is the point.
#
# Bounded: after `rollout status` the remaining work is the old pod's
# termination grace, so 120s is generous; on timeout the pod list is

## use: switch the hello-world agent to a model preset from k8s/models/
# (e.g. make use PRESET=anthropic). Hosted presets need their Secret first
# (make model-secret) — and remember: P2 spend is ungoverned until P4.
#
# One shell for apply + patch, because the wait that follows needs three
# values from BEFORE them. `wait_switched` keys its reconcile wait on the
# Agent's generation, which only moves when the Agent's spec does. Two
# switches leave it still and yet must roll the pods:
#   - the preset's YAML changed and hello-world is already on it (the
#     patch is a no-op; kagent rolls on the ModelConfig change alone);
#   - the preset was just CREATED under a name the Agent already carried.
# Verified 2026-09-02: a content-only ModelConfig change bumps its
# generation and kagent cuts a new Deployment revision within a second —
# without an Agent generation change. So when the ModelConfig's
# generation moved and the Agent's did not, wait (bounded, loud) for the
# Deployment's revision to advance past what it was before the apply;
# only then is `wait_switched`'s rollout/pod check looking at the new
# template. Identical content ("unchanged") moves neither generation and
# takes the fast path. Only a genuine NotFound may leave the "before"
# generation empty; any other read failure aborts.

# PROOF — a NetworkPolicy the CNI ignores is indistinguishable from one
# it enforces until something is shown to be blocked.

## netpol-verify: prove the boundary is ENFORCED, not merely present —
## policed pods demonstrably cannot reach ollama / the internet, against
## a control pod that can, plus an exec into the real Postgres pod.
## Creates and deletes a few BestEffort probe pods (~2 minutes). Runs on
## every PR in CI. The script guards its own context (like the tool
## probes), so no `guard` here — one banner, not two.

## ---- P7b: inbound connectors (docs/inbound.md) ----
#
# The plane's one ingress: an external event (a webhook) may trigger a
# kagent agent, on the plane's terms. The hooks live in the committed
# upstreams table (k8s/plane/upstreams.yaml); these targets issue the
# hook's identity, store its signing secret, deliver an event, and read
# the trail. Approving a hook rides the P4c targets unchanged:
# `make approvals` / `make approve ID=... USES=... TTL=...`.
HOOK          ?= demo
CRED_INBOUND  ?= inbound-demo
# Where a BEARER hook's token goes (kaimahi namespace: the caller is
# outside the cluster, not an agent). `-` discards the token: the right
# choice for SIGNED hooks, whose credential is an identity, not a bearer.
INBOUND_SECRET ?= -
EVENT         ?= Reply with exactly the word PONG.

## inbound-credential: issue the hook's plane credential, e.g.
##   make inbound-credential                                  (signed demo hook)
##   make inbound-credential CRED_INBOUND=inbound-bearer INBOUND_SECRET=kaimahi-inbound-token

## secret on stdin, or GENERATE=1 for a fresh one a Kaimahi-scheme caller
## is then told (see scripts/inbound-secret.sh for retrieval).
inbound-secret: guard
	@KUBECTL="$(KUBECTL)" HOOK=$(HOOK) bash scripts/inbound-secret.sh $(if $(GENERATE),--generate,)

## inbound-fire: deliver one event to a hook and report the plane's
## decision. Unguarded for the same reason `chat` is (it runs through
## the guarded probe script, which resolves and vets its own context).
##   make inbound-fire [HOOK=demo] [EVENT='...'] [AUTH=hmac|bearer|none|forged|stale]

## inbound-audit: the inbound event trail (decisions and outcomes, newest
## first) — every hook, unless HOOK=<name> is given on the command line.
## (HOOK's default serves inbound-fire/inbound-secret; an audit that
## silently narrowed to it would hide the other hooks' events.)
